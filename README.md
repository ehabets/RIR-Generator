# RIR-Generator

The image method, proposed by Allen and Berkley in 1979 [1], is probably one of the most frequently used methods in the acoustic signal processing community to create synthetic room impulse responses. 
A mex-function, which can be used in MATLAB, was developed to generate multi-channel room impulse responses using the image method. 
This function enables the user to control the reflection order, room dimension, and microphone directivity. 

This repository includes a tutorial, MATLAB examples, and the source code of the mex-function.
